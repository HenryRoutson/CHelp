Change to n unfreed of type 
  and get user defined enum to create types

write test for n unfreed of ...
improve n unfreed of ...
Make n_unfreed_of_type faster with cache?
  Will need another data array 
    O(number of allocs) -> O(number of alloc types)

Create 1:count, 2:macro and 3:full versions

seperate config from setup
Move docs to markdown

multithreading, see // https://gamepipeline.org/forge_Debugging_.html

n_unfreed_type() with filter on type, IE for a linked list n_unfreed_type(list.length, node_t)

NOT DOING
alloc more and check if out of bounds is modified   - leave to valgrind
improve make file - can't be bothered
