# How CHELP works

At its core, CHelp counts of how many allocations remain at the end of your program.
If there are more than 0, you have a memory leak.

This is obviously extremely performant.

Done manually the process looks like this.


```C

// done manually

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>

long num_unfreed_allocs = 0;

int main() {

  int *allocation = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
  num_unfreed_allocs++;
  
  free(allocation);
  num_unfreed_allocs--; 
  
  assert(num_unfreed_allocs == 0); // no memory leaks!
}

```


Tracking the number of unfreed allocations can be automated.


```C

// done automatically

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define malloc(s) malloc(s); num_unfreed_allocs++;
#define free(p)     free(p); num_unfreed_allocs--;
// other functions are required ...

long num_unfreed_allocs = 0;

int main() {

  int *allocation = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
  free(allocation);
  
  assert(num_unfreed_allocs == 0); // no memory leaks!
}


```

And then extracted into external files and functions used to make error output better.

```C


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include "help/help.h"

CHELP_MAIN_MACRO

int main() {

  int *allocation = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
  free(allocation);
  
  n_unfreed(0); // no memory leaks!
}


```

And so now we have an easy way of detecting memory leaks.


# Other advanced features of CHELP


Obviously just knowing there is a problem isn't that helpful, so at this point you could probably just use rerun using valgrind, and there is a simple version of CHelp if want to this, However ...


# Valgrind 

Chelp compared to Valgrind ... 

```

‚úÖ Is cross platform

‚úÖ Runs in the background, rather than only being run occasionally.

  Which avoids ...
  1 Allowing bugs to build up and obfuscating what changes caused them.
  2 Requiring you to rurun recreate error contitions.

‚úÖ Is comparatively fast.

‚úÖ Provides extra information about leaked memory.

‚úÖ Allows you to attatch extra information to allocations.

‚úÖ Allows you to print out allocations and frees when they occur.

‚úÖ Allows you to have assert the number of allocations you should have across multiple points in your programs execution.

‚úÖ Allows you to print all unfreed allocations at any point in your program.

‚úÖ Allows typed allocs, and for you to assert a number of unfreed allocs of a type. Allowing you to do something like, assert a linked list length is equal to the number of unfreed list_node allocations.

    assert(n_unfreed_of_type(LIST_TYPE, list.length));

‚ùå 
  Valgrind has functionality for other errors CHelp doesn't have,
  and simply cannot support.
  You should use CHelp and valgrind in conjunction when developing C.

‚ùå 
  No cross language support.

```

Chelp has a number of features, which in some aspects make it better than Valgrind.

The idea for this project was largely inspired by this video:

How i program C, Eskil Steenberg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=443UNeGrFoM at 48:48

Although implimentation differs significantly

Codebase
https://gamepipeline.org/forge_Debugging_.html

‚úÖ storing data before allocs to make O(n) pointer search O(1)
‚úÖ storing allocation and free counts to for leak checks O(1)  
‚úÖ retaining allocation order
‚ùå No multithreading (yet)
‚ùå No overallocation (leaving this to valgrind)

```
